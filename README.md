Also included is a map that shows the customer's driving direction map throughout the west coast of Mexico. The 4 citys chosen were Kantunilkin, Flagstaff, San Quintin, Pacific Grove and Salinas. 


Next, using the Google Maps Directions API, I created a travel route between the four cities as well as a marker layer map.

This includes latitude, longitude, maximum temperature, percent humidity, percent cloudiness, wind speed and weather description.

-Using Customer input real-time, with respect to temperature range, rain fall and snow requirements, customer friendly maps were created that shows the required information
